Additionally, I changed it to an assertEquals so that in the event of another failure, we can see exactly what the counter ended up being, which will help with debugging. 1 status:underreview 4 6","Fix flaky tests for throttling pattern #643 Fix flaky tests for throttling pattern I took a look at the Travis logs and the troublesome test.

Adding a print to indicate which PTX version we are actually using,"Changes to allow correct occupancy with newer cards, while still running PTXPlus","I added a new environment variable: PTXAS_CUDA_INSTALL_PATH which allows the user to specify a different PTXAS version than the default CUDA version. Why would you need this? When running PTXPLus (sm_13 sass) and a new configuration, like PASCAL or VOLTA you actually need 2 versions of CUDA.
The apps need to be compiled with CUDA <=4.2 to get sm_13. Similarly the simulator needs to use CUDA <= 4.2 to parse the apps. However, we need to get occupancy numbers assuming the code was compiled to a newer architecture (sm_7x in volta). To do this, you need a newer version of CUDA. Therefore; to run PTXPlus AND a modern config you need to specify CUDA_INSTALL_PATH to use an older CUDA and PTXAS_INSTALL_PATH to use a newer CUDA.
